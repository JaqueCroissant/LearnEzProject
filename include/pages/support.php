I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words.

Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text.
